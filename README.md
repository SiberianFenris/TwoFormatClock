# TwoFormatClock
Two clocks displayed in console (12/24 hours) has menu to modify time. Coded in C++

This was a project for my C++ course (CS-210). The program displays two clocks with one being in 12 hour format and the other in 24 hour format.
There is also a menu that prompts a user to press 1, 2, or 3 to modify either the hour, minute, or second of the clock by 1. If the user selects 4 it exits the program.

This is my first C++ program.
